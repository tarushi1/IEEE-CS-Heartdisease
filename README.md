The model developed in the provided code is a binary classification model designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various medical and clinical features.
The goal of the model is to predict whether an individual has heart disease (target = 1) using a dataset containing features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other clinical indicators.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets. 
We chose a simple but effective method called logistic regression to teach our program how to make predictions.
We measured how well our program did in predicting if someone has heart disease by looking at metrics like accuracy (how often it was right), precision (how accurate it was when it said someone has heart disease), and recall (how good it was at catching all cases of heart disease).
